gb-builder
==========

Gulp based compiler for SASS and JS that outputs to a Wordpress theme folder and can be cleanly removed from a development site for production.

1. Simply place a copy of the gb-builder folder in the Wordpress site's root folder.
2. In the terminal navigate to the gb-builder folder, e.g.
```
cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/wordpress/gb-builder/
```
4. Run ```npm install```
5. Edit the 'gulpfile.js' and change the 'themename' variable to the name of your wordpress theme.
6. In the terminal run ```gulp```

That's it!
